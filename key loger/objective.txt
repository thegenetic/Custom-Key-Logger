1. Basic Key Logger to Capture Keystrokes
Objective: Capture all keystrokes and save them to a text file.
Steps:
- Use the pynput library’s keyboard.Listener to capture keystrokes.
- Set up a simple function to record each keystroke.
- Write each keystroke to a local text file as they’re typed.
- Test by running the script and verifying that it logs the keystrokes to the text file.
New Skills: Working with listeners, file I/O for storing logs.

2. Capture Special Keys and Format Output
Objective: Make the keylogger more readable by distinguishing between letters, numbers, and special keys.
Steps:
- Add logic to recognize special keys (e.g., Enter, Backspace, Space).
- Format the output to display special keys like [ENTER] or [SPACE] instead of just logging raw keystrokes.
- Update the file output to include timestamped entries.
New Skills: Handling key events more selectively and creating more organized logs.

3. Email Keystrokes (Basic Email Logging)
Objective: Send logged keystrokes to an email address at intervals.
Steps:
- Set up a function to send emails using Python’s smtplib.
- Collect keystrokes in memory and send them every few minutes.
- Use threading or timed intervals to manage email frequency.
New Skills: Sending emails in Python, handling data over timed intervals, and managing memory.

4. Stealth Mode (Run as Background Process)
Objective: Make the keylogger run in the background.
Steps:
- Configure the keylogger to run as a minimized or hidden process.
- Set it up to run on startup if you’re on your local machine (be careful with this on personal systems).
- Test it by confirming that it logs data while minimized or hidden.
New Skills: Background processing, managing Python scripts on system startup.

5. Encrypt and Decrypt Keystroke Logs
Objective: Add basic encryption to the saved logs for additional security.
Steps:
- Use a library like cryptography to encrypt and decrypt log files.
- Encrypt keystrokes before saving them, and create a separate script to decrypt logs.
New Skills: Basic encryption and decryption, file security.

6. Add Network Transmission (Advanced)
Objective: Capture keystrokes and send them to a remote server.
Steps:
- Set up a server that can receive and store data (using Flask or Django, for example).
- Use Python’s requests library to send keystrokes to the server at intervals.
New Skills: Network communication in Python, basic server setup for logging.
